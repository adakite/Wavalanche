Tools for seismically analyzing avalanches



This project is at a very preliminary stage and shouldn't evolve very quickly. Most of the work is based on several papers, such as Ekstrom & Stark, (2013); Brodsky et al., (2003); Favreau et al., (2010) and associated references. Details will be given as soon as possible.

The project will contain source code and associated makefiles (if any) as well as several sets of both synthetic and actual data so people can test and verify that each program runs smoothly on their respective system.
